Python, Git & Linux — Theory Test
Answer Sheet

---

## PYTHON

1. Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).

2. A dictionary stores data as key–value pairs, while a list stores ordered elements accessed by index.

3. `self` refers to the current instance of a class and is used to access instance attributes and methods.

4. A class attribute is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance attribute belongs to a specific object.

5. The constructor initializes an object’s data when an instance of the class is created.

6. Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal implementation details of a class and exposing only what is necessary, usually through naming conventions or methods.

7. Protected attributes use a single underscore (`_attribute`) and are meant for internal use, while private attributes use double underscores (`__attribute`) and are name-mangled.

8. Functions being first-class objects means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

9. `==` compares values for equality, while `is` checks whether both variables reference the same object in memory.

10. The same mutable object is reused across function calls, which can cause unexpected behavior.

11. Recursion is when a function calls itself. It must have a base case and a recursive case.

12. `@staticmethod` defines a method that belongs to a class but does not access instance or class data.

## GIT

13. `git fetch` downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them, while `git pull` downloads and merges them.

14. A branch is an independent line of development that allows developers to work on features without affecting the main codebase.

15. A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches.

16. `git stash` temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and return later.

## LINUX / CLI

17. `pwd` prints the current working directory.

18. `cp` copies files or directories, while `mv` moves or renames them.

19. `sudo` allows a command to run with superuser privileges and should be used carefully to avoid damaging the system.

20. Command: `ls -a`
    Hidden files start with a dot (`.`) and are usually configuration or system files.
